# Smart-Hospital
A remote smart healthcare system is proposed for monitoring patients’ health status and receiving doctors’ prescriptions by a workstation nurse in the hospital and medication nurse for supplying patient with the suitable medicine while patients staying at home.

Besides this 
the Manager can also follow up the data analysis from data collected remotely from the 
patients and Medication nurse performance for specific management decisions. With the 
proposed system, patients can be remotely monitored from their homes, and can also live a 
more comfortable life through the use of some features of smart home and hospital healthcare 
system on their websites so that there are a lot of problems in hospitals such as the crowds 
during the pandemic, high infection, medical staff shortage, monitoring of chronic patients, 
and high cost.

This project focuses on solving those problems through:

   • Monitoring the patients from home and transferring vital signs of the patients to workstation of the hospital such as blood pressure, spo2, heart rate, and temperature.

   • Hospital will provide a medication nurse to give medicines to the patients.

   • Workstation nurse for monitoring patients and will contact a doctor if any abnormalities occur and send an ambulance to home of the patient.
